      I graduated in Physics from the National University of Engineering in Peru. Then, I moved to Brazil and got a Master's degree in Physics from the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) working on relativistic heavy-ion collisions. For the Ph.D., also in Physics, I got enrolled in the first joint Ph.D./cotutelle program between Unicamp and McGill University in Canada. I worked on new models of dark matter: asymmetric dark matter, heavy neutral leptons, and decaying dark matter. I also have experience in vacuum stability, 3-3-1 and B-L models, dark photons and indirect detection of dark matter.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
